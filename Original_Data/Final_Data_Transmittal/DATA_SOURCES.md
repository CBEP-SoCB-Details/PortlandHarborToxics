#  Source of Data in 'Final Data Transmittal'
Received in e-mail from Michael Johnson of Stantec, dated February 4, 2020.

Data originally collected by Glenn Daukas of Campbell Environmental
Cite formal report as follows:

Cambell Environmental Group, Inc. 2019.  Bulk Chemistry Dredge Sediment Sampling
and Harbor Assessment Report, Portland Harbor, Portland and South Portland,
Maine. Report Prepared For Portland Harbor Commission, Maine Trade Center, Suite 105,
2 Portland Fish Pier, Portland, ME 04101.

# Comment on SQuiRTs in the Transmitted Data
The SQuiRTs (ERMs) shown in the secondary tables as received may be in
inconsistent units.  The SQuiRTs are expressed in ppb DRY weight basis, But the
laboratory analysis provided results in mg/kg or ug/kg, which are often reported
on a wet weight basis.  Nothing I could find in the data report addresses the
units of the original concentrations.

I have (August 24, 2020) submitted a question to Glenn Daukus to seek
clarification.  If original data were expresed on a wt weight basis, we need
to revise outr analysis to account for moisture in the original samples.
