# Processing to Produce Working Versions of data
*  'Working Data.xls' is just a copy of "draft_Combined_data_20190917.xls" as
assembled by Stantec.

*  'Marine Sediment Screening Values simplified.xlsx' is just a version of the
screening values, with unrelated screening levels removed and screening levels
for all parameters combined into one table. Simplification done by Curtis C.
Bohlen, October 7, 2019.

*  'PORTLAND VB TARGET LOCATIONS EDITED.csv' derived from 'PORTLAND VB TARGET
LOCATIONS.csv' by adding a header row.

*  TARGET LOCATIONS.csv'  Calculated 'decimal degrees (in excel) based on the 
lat and long values in that file.

*  'Locations Table from Bulk Chemistry Report.docx' Converted by hand by
copying data from the draft bulk chemistry report, table 2

*  'Locations Table from Bulk Chemistry Report.xlsx' by copying and pasting from the word document. 
*  'Locations Crosswalk.xlsx' derived by hand from that excel file.

# Metadata for the Screening Values included in the Excel files.
The list of PCB congeners and alternate terminology from here:

reporting Total PCBs, nomenclature does not matter all that much. 

# GIS Files
'Portand_Dredge_Locations.mxd' Contains ArcGIS map file.
Shapefile 'Portland Toxics Locations' Derived from the NEED TO INSERT WHERE THIS WAS DERIVED FROM
